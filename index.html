        <h1>What we do?</h1>
        <p>This website's major objective is to schedule and track ambulances from both the user's and the hospital's perspectives.
        As we all know, ambulances are hired on a contract basis and shared among hospitals in the same region. As a result, it
        is difficult to track an ambulance until it has arrived at its destination. The ambulance driver has a difficult time
        locating a certain site in the streets, and it regularly becomes stuck in traffic, wasting valuable time. Users may
        utilise this to call the ambulance driver for help finding the address, and the driver can also alert the user of any
        troubles he is having, such as traffic or vehicle damage, so that they can schedule another ambulance.
